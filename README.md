1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?


I have always had a strong interest in learning new concepts and development in technologies. I am a person who enjoys the challenge of exploring and finding innovative solutions. I identify myself as a “STEM”; Science, Technology, Engineering and Math person and believe this program is a great perfect fit for my skillset and passion. 

Another reason why I am interested in programming is due to my love for Computer Science from a young age. After completing my High School Diploma, I began to study engineering by taking pre-engineering courses. I also got the chance to learn coding at that time however, I had to quit and as I resettled to the United States. After I got here, I thought it would be easier to change majors and try something new. After taking a one-year of Pre-Nursing school, I realized that it was not what I wanted to do.

   One year ago, I left my school in Iowa and moved to this high tech city Seattle. After moving this city I was encouraged to follow my passion for engineering and coding field. In the meantime, I have been increasing my studies, taking free online coding sources via the the internet like w3schools and Udemy. I loved it! I started to go to a tutoring class called HahuIT training in Bellevue, which expanded my knowledge and interest for this field. In this program, I began as beginning and moved my way up to basic up to advanced level of database concepts, basic database querying, data warehousing, and some SSIS and SSRS. I also created an Insurance company database project on my own and participated on a group project to create Adventureworks Data Warehouse. I also studied C# programming language and some HTML, CSS and JavaScript independently.  
   
   2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 year


    If I were to get accepted into Ada program, my hope is to gain knowledge and experience that will open a new door of opportunity to join to this very broad and highly competitive technology world and to start my career as a Software Developer. 

    If you ask me where I see myself in five years, I would say growing deeply with the IT field by maintaining a broad technical experience and effort to become an expert in the field. In addition, I see myself continuing my education and earning new certifications to stay current to the constantly changing trends in the field that improves my qualifications and increase my marketability as I hope to progress up to senior level positions one day. 

. 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? 


   I moved to the United States four years ago from my country of origin Eritrea, which is has a very different culture and background. At first, I used to feel a little afraid and uncomfortable to get involved in any kind of activities due to barriers. However, after residing here for a couple months, I found that people here are very open, inclusive and multicultural, which encouraged me to grow outside my boundaries and learn something new about a culture that I am not familiar with. It also enabled me to become more proactive in listening, accepting, and welcoming people and ideas that are different from my own.

    I believe every person is unique, and that every person can make a lasting and positive contribution to the larger society despite his or her differences. That is what Ada stands for: to build and contribute to a supportive community where everybody is recognized, respected and valued. I am hoping to be accepted and to become a part of this diverse community to empower others and achieve my full potential as a woman of color. I would relish the opportunity to make a difference and to commit to Ada’s mission of diversifying the Tech field. 
    
    4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?


    I am not going to call it a mistake but an experience as I got to learn something from it.  So many things can influence, change and affect somebody's life style and plan. It has been three years since I resettled in the USA and have always been ready to attend college and earn my degree. When it comes to choosing a major, I was always clear about what I wanted to do with my life however when I moved to the U.S. I shifted my focus on getting a short and more in demand major. Therefore, I decided to study Nursing, which I never dreamed of doing before. After taking prerequisite courses for nursing, I realized that it was not what I truly wanted to do. In the process, I ended up wasting my money and time.

   Even though discovering and exploring other areas of study is a good thing, I still feel like this was a mistake because I knew what I wanted to do from the beginning. Instead of following my dreams, I switched to some other very different path due to pressure and changes. Trusting yourself and your area of interest is a very crucial point of a life and should all listen to. When you do what you love, you can make big a huge impact, which I can do with Ada. It is important to follow your dreams because I believe everybody can be successful when we pursue our passion and will ultimately be happy with what they are doing. I think it is very common not to know your area of interest or to feel confident; however, I learned that believing your interest, your strengths as well as weakness, will help you make the right steps towards the right career for you. I have learned so much from my mistake and looking forward to continuing to do what I love.
